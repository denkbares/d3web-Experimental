!!! KnowWE Hello World Plugin Demo page

This page demonstrates the Hello World Plugin for KnowWE. The Hello World Plugin Ã­s meant to be a example-oriented tutorial to the very basics of KnowWE programming.

!! The Hello-KnowWE-type
The plugin has registered a KnowWEType to the system on initialization. All registered types searched at page saves.
The registered type of this plugin listens to:

{{{
Hello KnowWE!
}}}

When this is found (not in verbatim environment) it is marked in the internal data-structure (KDOM) and will be rendered by the specified renderer, which looks like this:

Hello KnowWE!

!! The Hello-KnowWE-TagHandler

The plugin also has registered a basic taghandler by the name 'helloworld'. For taghandlers the markup is predefined and looks like:

{{{
[{KnowWEPlugin helloworld, count=4}]
}}}

When this is found (not in verbatim environment) the tagHandler is translated according to its defined render-method, which looks like this:

[{KnowWEPlugin helloworld, count=4}]
