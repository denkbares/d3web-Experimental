The evalutaion of the exhaust pipe color depends on the type of fuel:

IF (Fuel = unleaded gasoline AND Exhaust pipe color = sooty black)
THEN Exhaust pipe color evaluation += abnormal

IF (Fuel = diesel AND Exhaust pipe color = sooty black)
THEN Exhaust pipe color evaluation += normal  

IF (Exhaust pipe color = brown OR Exhaust pipe color = grey OR Exhaust pipe color = light grey)
THEN Exhaust pipe color evaluation += normal  

Mileage is slightly increased when real mileage is between 110 and 130 percent of the average mileage:

IF ("Num. Mileage evaluation" >= 110 AND "Num. Mileage evaluation" <= 130)
THEN Mileage evaluation = slightly increased 


Mileage is definitly increased if the real mileage is more than 130 percent of the average mileage:

IF "Num. Mileage evaluation" > 130
THEN Mileage evaluation = increased  

Mileage evaluation is normal when it is lower than 110 percent of average mileage:

IF "Num. Mileage evaluation" < 110
THEN Mileage evaluation = normal

Compute the percentual mileage increase from the real and the average mileage:

IF "Average mileage /100km" > 0 AND KNOWN["Real mileage  /100km"]
THEN "Num. Mileage evaluation" = (("Real mileage  /100km" / "Average mileage /100km") * 100.0)
