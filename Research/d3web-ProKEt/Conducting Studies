How To Conduct User Studies with ProKEt support


Studies based on Prototypes
---------------------------
- create distinct webapps for each desired prototype to test
    --> adapt in DialogServlet the folder for logfiles
    --> adapt index.jsp to point to respective dialog from beginning on
        - e.g. plain index.jsp or indexOQD.jsp with pre-browser test
- create log folders on server and give tomcat the write permission:
    mkdir G1-Data (in /var/lib/tomcat6/)
    chown -R tomcat6:tomcat6 /var/lib/tomcat6/G1-Data/


- Preprocess log data with UEStudyAnalyst.java (or equal own analyzer file)
    --> results in csv with basic log data
