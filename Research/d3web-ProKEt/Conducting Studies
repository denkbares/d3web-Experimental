How To Conduct User Studies with ProKEt support


Studies based on Prototypes
---------------------------
- create distinct webapps for each desired prototype to test
    --> adapt in DialogServlet the folder for logfiles
    --> adapt index.jsp to point to respective dialog from beginning on
        - e.g. plain index.jsp or indexOQD.jsp with pre-browser test
- create log folder on server and give tomcat the write permission:
    mkdir LOGS (in /var/lib/tomcat6/)
    chown -R tomcat6:tomcat6 /var/lib/tomcat6/LOGS/

- get data folder from server:
    - create (or empty) LOGS dir on home folder on KI server
    - create LOGS folder in user dir locally
    - log in to KI server and do
        scp -r root@132.187.15.11:/var/lib/tomcat6/LOGS LOGS
    - log out and do the following from local console:
        scp -r  mfreiberg@132.187.15.1:LOGS/* LOGS

- Preprocess log data with UEStudyAnalyst.java (or equal own analyzer file)
    --> results in csv with basic log data
