How To Conduct User Studies with ProKEt support


Studies based on Prototypes
---------------------------
- create distinct webapps for each desired prototype to test
    --> adapt in DialogServlet the folder for logfiles
    --> adapt index.jsp to point to respective dialog from beginning on
        - e.g. plain index.jsp or indexOQD.jsp with pre-browser test

- Preprocess log data with UEStudyAnalyst.java (or equal own analyzer file)
    --> results in csv with basic log data
