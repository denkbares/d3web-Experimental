Pack years.popup = """
<b>Definition of pack years:</b> it is a way to measure the amount a person has smoked over a long period of time.<br/>
It is calculated by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years the person has smoked.<br/>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>pack years</b> = packs smoked per day  X  years as a smoker<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example:</b> 1 pack year is equal to smoking 1 pack per day for 1 year, or 2 packs per day for half a year, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As 1 pack is assumed to have 20 cigarettes, alternatively:<br/>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>pack years</b> = number of cigarettes smoked per day  X  number of years smoked 20<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example:</b> a patient who has smoked 12 cigarettes a day for 30 years has a (12x30)/20 = 18 pack years smoking history.
