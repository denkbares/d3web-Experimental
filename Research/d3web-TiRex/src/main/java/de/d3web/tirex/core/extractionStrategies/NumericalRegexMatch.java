 * which can be matched by any of the regular expressions used by this strategy,
 * then it will be returned immediately, though it's most likely not the
 * Question that was to be found.
 * 
 * This ExtractionStrategy is trying to match a substring within a piece of text
 * by applying regular expressions. The regular expressions currently used can
 * extract german figures of speech that indicate certain quantities of
 * something - thus the "Numerical" within the name of the strategy.
